Agent from pygent import Agent Manages the conversation with the model. Each instance owns a Runtime accessible via agent.runtime . Methods step(user_msg: str) -> None \u2013 add a message and run any tools returned by the model. run_interactive(use_docker: bool | None = None) -> None \u2013 start an interactive session. run_gui(use_docker: bool | None = None) -> None \u2013 start a simple web interface. Runtime Executes commands either in a Docker container or locally. Methods bash(cmd: str, timeout: int = 30) -> str \u2013 run a shell command and return its output. write_file(path: str, content: str) -> str \u2013 create or replace a UTF-8 encoded text file in the working directory. cleanup() -> None \u2013 destroy the temporary workspace and stop the container if used. Tools Several tools are available by default: bash \u2013 executes shell commands via Runtime.bash . write_file \u2013 writes files through Runtime.write_file . delegate_task \u2013 start a background task handled by a new agent, optionally copying files into it. task_status \u2013 check the progress of a delegated task. collect_file \u2013 copy a file from a delegated task into the current workspace. download_file \u2013 retrieve the contents of a file from the workspace. Additional tools can be registered programmatically using pygent.register_tool or the pygent.tool decorator. Each tool receives the active Runtime instance and must return a string. from pygent import register_tool def hello(rt, name: str) -> str: return f\"Hello {name}!\" register_tool( \"hello\", \"Greet the user\", {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"name\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"name\"]}, hello, ) Refer to the tools.py module for more details. TaskManager Launch separate agents asynchronously and track them: from pygent import TaskManager, Runtime rt = Runtime(use_docker=False) tm = TaskManager() task_id = tm.start_task( \"generate report\", rt, files=[\"data.txt\"], step_timeout=5, task_timeout=60, ) print(tm.status(task_id)) Pass a Runtime instance when starting a task so files can be copied into the sub-agent workspace via the optional files argument. Delegated agents cannot create further tasks. The maximum number of concurrent tasks is controlled by the PYGENT_MAX_TASKS environment variable (default 3 ). Optional step_timeout and task_timeout parameters control how long each step and the overall task are allowed to run. Their defaults can be set via the PYGENT_STEP_TIMEOUT and PYGENT_TASK_TIMEOUT environment variables. Custom prompts Pass a custom string to the Agent constructor to override the system prompt: from pygent import Agent ag = Agent(system_msg=\"You are a friendly bot\") Custom models The Agent relies on a model object with a chat method. The default is OpenAIModel which calls an OpenAI-compatible API. To plug in a different backend, implement the Model protocol and pass an instance when creating the agent.","title":"API Reference"},{"location":"api-reference/#api-reference","text":"This section summarises the most relevant classes and functions.","title":"API Reference"},{"location":"api-reference/#agent","text":"from pygent import Agent Manages the conversation with the model.

By default a Docker container is used, but if Docker is unavailable the commands run locally instead. This page shows how to install the package and gives a few examples covering the main features. Installation Install from source in editable mode so the CLI and Python modules are available. Include the optional extras to enable Docker support and the web UI: pip install pygent[docker,ui] Python 3.9 or newer is required. If Docker is not installed omit the [docker] extras and commands will run on the host system. Interactive session Start an interactive session by running pygent in a terminal. Use the --docker flag to force container execution or --no-docker to run locally. $ pygent --docker vc> echo \"Hello\" Each message is executed in the sandbox and the output printed. Use /exit to leave the session. You can also launch a simple web interface with pygent-ui (requires the ui extra). Tool usage During the conversation the assistant can call two built-in tools: bash to run shell commands and write_file to create files inside the workspace. For example: vc> write_file path=\"hello.txt\" content=\"Hello from Pygent\" vc> bash cmd=\"cat hello.txt\" Using the API The same functionality is accessible programmatically via the Agent class: from pygent import Agent ag = Agent() ag.step(\"echo 'Hello World'\") ag.runtime.cleanup() See api_example.py for a complete script. Additional examples show how to implement a custom model and how to interact with the Runtime class directly. Configuration Pygent communicates with the model through an OpenAI\u2011compatible API. Export your API key before running the assistant. A full list of environment variables is available in the Configuration page. For full control you may pass a custom model implementation to Agent . The file custom_model.py contains a minimal echo model example.
