# Welcome to Pygent

**Pygent** is a minimalist and powerful coding assistant designed to execute tasks in a secure and isolated environment. By default, it uses Docker containers to ensure commands are run safely, but it can also operate locally if Docker is unavailable.

Whether you're looking to automate development tasks, generate code, or simply experiment with a secure AI assistant, Pygent offers the tools and flexibility you need.

## Highlights

* **Secure Execution**: Commands run in ephemeral Docker containers by default.
* **Flexibility**: Integrates with language models compatible with the OpenAI API.
* **Extensibility**: Create your own tools, customize system prompts, and extend the CLI with custom commands.
* **Persistence**: Save and recover your workspace state between sessions.
* **Dual Interface**: Use Pygent via an interactive CLI or a simple web interface.
