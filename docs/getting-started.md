# Getting Started

Pygent is a minimalist coding assistant that runs shell commands inside a
sandboxed environment. By default a Docker container is used, but if Docker
is unavailable the commands run locally instead. This page shows how to install
the package and gives a few examples covering the main features.

## Installation

The recommended way to install Pygent is using pip:

```bash
pip install pygent
```

To include optional features like Docker support or the web UI, you can specify extras:

```bash
pip install pygent[docker,ui]
```

Python 3.9 or newer is required. If Docker is not installed on your system, you should omit the `[docker]` extra; commands that would use Docker will then run on the host system instead. Docker itself needs to be installed separately if you wish to use containerized execution.

For developers or those wanting the latest unreleased features, Pygent can also be installed from source:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
You can include extras like `[docker,ui]` when installing from source as well (e.g., `pip install -e .[docker,ui]`).

## Interactive session

Start an interactive session by running `pygent` in a terminal. Use the
`--docker` flag to force container execution or `--no-docker` to run locally.
The CLI prints the persona name and whether commands run `local` or in
`Docker` when the session starts so you know which agent is active.

```bash
$ pygent --docker
vc> echo "Hello"
```

Each message is executed in the sandbox and the output printed. Use `/exit`
to leave the session. You can also launch a simple web interface with
`pygent ui` (or the old `pygent-ui` script, requires the `ui` extra).

Use `/help` inside the CLI to list available commands or `/help <cmd>`
for details. The helper shows `/cmd` to run a raw shell command,
`/cp` to copy files into the workspace and `/new` to restart the
conversation while keeping the current runtime.
Use `/tools` to enable or disable specific tools on the fly.
Pass `--confirm-bash` when launching the CLI to require confirmation
before running any `bash` command.
Add `--ban-cmd NAME` to prevent certain commands entirely.
The `/save DIR` command copies the workspace, the CLI log and relevant
configuration for later use.  Resume the session with
`pygent --load DIR`.
Use `/banned` inside the CLI to list or modify the banned commands.

### Tool usage

During the conversation the assistant can call several built-in tools. `bash`
runs shell commands and `write_file` creates files inside the workspace. For
example:

```text
vc> write_file path="hello.txt" content="Hello from Pygent"
vc> bash cmd="cat hello.txt"
```

You can disable all built-in tools with `pygent.clear_tools()` or
remove a specific one with `pygent.remove_tool("bash")`. Restore the
defaults at any time using `pygent.reset_tools()`. The system prompt will
update automatically to list the tools currently registered.

## Using the API

The same functionality is accessible programmatically via the `Agent` class:

```python
from pygent import Agent

ag = Agent()
ag.step("echo 'Hello World'")
ag.runtime.cleanup()
```

See [api_example.py](https://github.com/marianochaves/pygent/blob/main/examples/api_example.py)
for a complete script. Additional examples show how to implement a custom model
and how to interact with the `Runtime` class directly.

## Configuration

Pygent communicates with the model through an OpenAIâ€‘compatible API. Export your
API key before running the assistant. A full list of environment variables is
available in the [Configuration](configuration.md) page.

For full control you may pass a custom model implementation to `Agent`. The file
[custom_model.py](https://github.com/marianochaves/pygent/blob/main/examples/custom_model.py)
contains a minimal echo model example. A dedicated [Custom Models](custom-models.md)
page expands on this topic with additional scenarios.

## Additional examples

Several scripts in the `examples/` directory showcase different parts of the
package (see the dedicated [Examples](examples.md) page):

- **api_example.py** &ndash; minimal use of the :class:`~pygent.agent.Agent` API.
- **runtime_example.py** &ndash; running commands through the
  :class:`~pygent.runtime.Runtime` class directly.
- **write_file_demo.py** &ndash; calling the built-in tools from Python code.
- **custom_model.py** &ndash; plugging in a custom model.

Below is the custom model snippet for reference:

```python
from pygent import Agent, openai_compat

class EchoModel:
    def chat(self, messages, model, tools):
        last = messages[-1]["content"]
        return openai_compat.Message(role="assistant", content=f"Echo: {last}")

ag = Agent(model=EchoModel())
ag.step("test")
ag.runtime.cleanup()
```

Custom models can also issue tool calls. The following model runs the last user
message as a `bash` command:

```python
import json
from pygent import Agent, openai_compat


class BashModel:
    def chat(self, messages, model, tools):
        cmd = messages[-1]["content"]
        call = openai_compat.ToolCall(
            id="1",
            type="function",
            function=openai_compat.ToolCallFunction(
                name="bash",
                arguments=json.dumps({"cmd": cmd}),
            ),
        )
        return openai_compat.Message(role="assistant", content=None, tool_calls=[call])


ag = Agent(model=BashModel())
ag.step("echo hi")
ag.runtime.cleanup()
```

See the [API reference](api-reference.md) for the complete list of classes and
configuration options.
